"""
TracingContext is the source of truth for all currently accumulated information
needed to trace. Its lifecycle is kept 1:1 when using TorchDynamo, but other systems
are open to managing their own TracingContext with that in mind.

The purpose of TracingContext is not to be a dumping ground, or god object, but rather to avoid
having to plumb complex subsystems across multiple verticals.

Ex: A common example is guard accumulation between dynamo, shape_env, aot_autograd, and inductor.
Accessing the current tracing context via
TracingContext.get() allows users to accumulate their own guards for processing, without needing to know how
to plumb objects back up to where frame interpretation happened.

Note that you can end up with multiple TracingContext for a single compilation
of a frame, as we reset the TracingContext whenever we restart analysis.
CompileContext is a more overarching context that encompasses multiple restarts.
